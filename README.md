# Alphonce's Portfolio

This Django web app serves as a personal portfolio. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information.You can easily customize content and styles to make it your own.

# 1. Set the evironment for the project
# 2. Run pip install django
# 3. Start project using django-admin startproject project_name
# 4. Start an app using django-admin startapp app_name . 
Include the dot after the app_name so that django does not create redundant file directory
# 5. Add your app to the list of installed app in the settings.py file
